# Holberton School - SCM Basics

This repository contains my work for the **Git - SCM Basics** project.
The goal is to practice the core Git/GitHub workflow: commits, staging, remotes, branches,
merging conflicts, and rollbacks.

## Requirements

- Git installed and configured (user.name + user.email)
- GitHub account + repository remote
- Authentication using a Personal Access Token (PAT) when needed

## Files

- README.md — project overview
- .gitignore — ignored patterns (example: *.log)
- greeting.txt — created in a feature branch
- message.txt — edited on main during workflow practice

## Tasks

- 0. Initial Setup — install/configure Git and set identity
- 1. First Commits — create README.md, use staging, commit, create .gitignore
- 2. Push and Pull with Remote Repository — connect to GitHub, push/pull changes
- 3. Branch Creation — create a branch and commit changes separately
- 4. Merge and Conflict Resolution — merge branches and resolve conflicts
- 5. Rollback to a Previous Version — restore stability using reset/revert
- 6. Complete Workflow — full GitHub Flow (branch → commit → push → PR → merge → rollback)
